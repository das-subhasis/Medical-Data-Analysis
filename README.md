Diagnosing and Predicting Illness through Analysis of Health Metrics in the Human Body

This project examines various health metrics of a human body, such as age, sex, weight, and height, which can be used to diagnose a person's health. Further, we can use these variables to predict any illness that the patient has or may have in the foreseeable future and provide treatment as soon as possible.
